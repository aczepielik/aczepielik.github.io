      <description>In this post I take a look at the resolution providing free transport for car drivers in case of huge air pollution, adopted in Krakow in 2015. Three versions of this resolution have been in use. In the first version, decision about providing free transport was on a basis of measurements from the previous day. But this method was criticized for having one-day lags in decisions. In the next version decisions were based on forecasts.</description>

      <description>When I was learning how to work with APIs in R few months ago, I discovered there is an API for tram locations and departures in my home town - Kraków. Since then I’ve been planning the analysis of tram delays based on it and eventually I’ve taken it as my personal summer project.
The entire report in Polish is dozens page long. Here, on the English side of the blog, I omit the overview of data preparation and technical details, which are important but not so much interesting and present several selected insights.</description>

      <description>I am a graduate student of Mathematics at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków and a data analysis enthusiast. As I owe a lot to many blog and tutorials authors, I have decided to start a blog by my own, to share some of my data insights.</description>
